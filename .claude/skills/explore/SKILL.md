Immediately invoke the Task tool with `subagent_type: "codebase-explorer"` to explore the codebase.

If the user provided a topic or area to explore, include that in the prompt. Otherwise, ask the user what they want to explore.

The prompt should specify:
- What feature, pattern, or system to investigate
- Why this exploration is needed (context from the conversation)
- Any specific files or directories to focus on
